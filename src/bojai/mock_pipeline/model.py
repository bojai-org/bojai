"""
This is your custom model file.

âœ… You are free to use ANY architecture here:
- PyTorch model (e.g., CNN, Transformer, MLP)
- Sklearn model (e.g., LogisticRegression, SVM)
- Even hand-coded rules or NumPy-based logic

There are NO base classes, NO requirements, and NO restrictions.
Just make sure the object you define here can be passed to your trainer class.

If you need to define your own tokenizer, you can define it here then import it in custom_data_processor.py

ðŸ‘‡ Example of a flexible placeholder model:
"""
class YourModel:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize your layers, sklearn estimator, or logic here
        self.model = None  # Replace with actual implementation

    def predict(self, x):
        """
        not required
        Run forward inference on a single input or batch
        This method is optional â€” only implement if your trainer uses it
        """
        pass

    def save(self, path):
        """
        not required
        Save your model to disk (optional).
        You can use torch.save, joblib, pickle, etc.
        """
        pass

    def load(self, path):
        """
        not required
        Load your model from disk (optional).
        """
        pass


"""
Youâ€™ll use this model object in:
- custom_trainer.py for training and evaluation
- custom_pipeline_user.py for inference
- global_vars.py to write the logic of initialising an object of this class. 
You can modify it however you want.
