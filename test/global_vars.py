    Call this function to finalize model initialization that depends on data or hyperparameters.

    This is necessary if your model requires:
    - Input/output dimensions that depend on the dataset
    - Hyperparameter-controlled architecture changes
    - Layer freezing or reweighting based on user config

    getNewModel() should return a base model object, but if it requires final setup using
    the dataset or hyperparameters, implement an `.init(data, hyper_params)` method inside your model class
    and call it here.

    Example:
        def init_model(data, model, hyper_params):
            model.init(data, hyper_params)

    If your model is fully defined without needing any external input, you can leave this function as `pass`.
